# ArchiFarmWCFBatch
Simple batch script I made to pin to my taskbar in order to have an easy access solution to stuff like 2fa and 2faok. 
Not that best code, and could definitely have an improved path setting solution, but people who know hoow it works should be able to figure out how to change the path.
